This is a brief list of the books I have read recently:

<center>{{< figure src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41brHoUIAiL._SX384_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" title="Writing Idiomatic Python by Jeff Knupp" width="220" height="196" >}}</center>


I really enjoyed going through [Jeffâ€™s posts](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/archives/). His book although concise it is straight to the point, laying out important fundamentals in a clear way.
