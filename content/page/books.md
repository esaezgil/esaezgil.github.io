This is a brief list of the books I have read recently:

I really enjoyed going through [Jeffâ€™s posts](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/archives/). His book although concise it is straight to the point, laying out important fundamentals in a clear way.

Listening to [Brett](https://twitter.com/haxor) on the [@TalkPython](https://twitter.com/TalkPython) [Podcast episode #25](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/25/effective-python) was pretty inspirational, starting from scratch with Python at his job at Google to leading teams and launching App Engine. I had to read his book and I am enjoying it and learning a lot.
