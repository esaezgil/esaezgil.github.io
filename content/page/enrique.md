I am Telecommunications Engineer passionate about the ICT industry. After attending four Universities in two countries, I have worked with people from all over the world in multidisciplinary teams.

During my [Master studies](http://www.en.aau.dk/education/master/wireless-communication-systems) at [Aalborg University](http://www.en.aau.dk/), Denmark, I had the opportunity to work in the [MassM2M research group](http://massm2m.es.aau.dk/) and participate in the entire product life-cycle, from the initial research up to the development of a prototype for a robust wireless communication system.<br>
Check [this video](https://vimeo.com/66733915) for a demo of the system transmitting audio over WiFi even after a jammer is switched on.

Furthermore, I had the chance to work for a short time at a startup, [Reseiwe](http://reseiwe.com/), that spin-off from this research group while completing my [Master Thesis](http://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/198541091/main_report_4_june.pdf).

I enjoy learning about new technologies, that I could eventually make use of to implement an innovative service.<br>
I like playing sports (football, padel), travelling around Europe and reading (Kapuściński, Tom Wolfe).

Currently, I am working as a software engineer at [Skyscanner] (http://skyscanner.net) and this blog is just a quick reference for mainly technical stuff I find interesting.

You can find more about me listening to this podcast: [CodeVoyagers - Episode 4] (https://soundcloud.com/code-voyagers/episode-4-a-graduates-journey)

I am also part of the Skyscanner Barcelona Ambassador group in charge of organizing events at the [@CodeVoyagers] (https://twitter.com/codevoyagers) office for the software developer community in Barcelona like the [Python meetup] (http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/python-185/) or the [Docker meetup] (https://www.meetup.com/docker-barcelona-spain/) among others. Feel free to get in touch if you are looking for a space to host your SW-related meetup in Barcelona
