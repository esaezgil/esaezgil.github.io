I am a telecom engineer working as a software engineer at [Skyscanner] (http://skyscanner.net). This blog is just a quick reference for mainly technical stuff I find interesting. If you wanna get in touch, hit me up on [@equirn] (https://twitter.com/eqirn)

You can find more about me listening to this podcast: [Episode 4 â€“ A graduates journey] (https://soundcloud.com/code-voyagers/episode-4-a-graduates-journey)

I am also part of the Skyscanner Barcelona Ambassador group in charge of organizing events at the [@CodeVoyagers] (https://twitter.com/codevoyagers) office for the software developer community in Barcelona like the [Python meetup] (http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/python-185/) or the [Docker meetup] (https://www.meetup.com/docker-barcelona-spain/) among others. Feel free to get in touch if you are looking for a space to host your SW-related meetup in Barcelona
