This is a brief list of the books I have read recently or I am reading at the moment:

<center>{{< figure src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41brHoUIAiL._SX384_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" title="Writing Idiomatic Python by Jeff Knupp" width="220" height="196" >}}</center>


I really enjoyed going through [Jeff’s posts](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/archives/). His book although concise it is straight to the point, laying out important fundamentals in a clear way.

Listening to [Brett](https://twitter.com/haxor) on the [@TalkPython](https://twitter.com/TalkPython) [Podcast episode #25](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/25/effective-python) was pretty inspirational, starting from scratch with Python at his job at Google to leading teams and launching App Engine. I had to read his book and I am enjoying it and learning a lot.

In one of our projects at [Skyscanner Hotels](https://www.skyscanner.net/hotels) we make use of [Kenneth Reitz's](https://twitter.com/kennethreitz) libraries: [Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests). That is how I found out about his book [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) that I made use extensively while preparing my [Python Best Practices](https://esaezgil.github.io/post/python_best_practices/) talk.

Another book which I read through for my [Python Best Practices](https://esaezgil.github.io/post/python_best_practices/) talk.
<center>{{< figure src="https://thehackerguidetopython.com/img/the-hacker-guide-to-python-darken-v2.png" title="The hacker's Guide to Python" width="220" height="196" >}}</center>
I also made use of Julien Danjou's [The hacker's Guide to Python](https://thehackerguidetopython.com/) for preparing the [Python Best Practices](https://esaezgil.github.io/post/python_best_practices/) talk.

<center>{{< figure src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WiLueukSL._SX396_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" title="Software Developer Life Manual by John Sonmez" width="220" height="196" >}}</center>
Again listening to episode [John Sonmez](https://twitter.com/jsonmez) on the [@TalkPython](https://twitter.com/TalkPython) [Podcast episode #71](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/71/soft-skills-the-software-developer-s-life-manual) I was curious about his book. I have read most of the book so far and the take out points for me were:

  - create a Blog
  - give value back to the community (contribute to OS, interesting blog posts)

<center>{{< figure src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Xz4UVM-0L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" title="The Effective Engineer by Edmond Lau" width="220" height="196" >}}</center>
This is a book we gave away as a prize at the [LauzHack Hackathon](http://lauzhack.com) in Switzerland which I [attended](https://esaezgil.github.io/events/) as a Skyscanner representative. I was curious about it and I am reading it now.
