During my studies in Denmark I attended two Summer Universities: [Aalborg University Summer School](http://www.summerschool.aau.dk/) and [DTU International Summer University](http://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/Guest-students/Summer-University).

During both summers I met new people from all over the world, made new friends and worked in projects that were not a core part of my regular curriculum but were super interesting.

DTU Summer University
---------------------

I attended DTU Summer University during summer of 2013 working along other students (coming from France, Italy and China) in two projects:

 - My favorite project involved modulating [VCSELs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical-cavity_surface-emitting_laser) for optical access and [FTTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x). I had the chance to tinker with lab equipment, simulators and finally write the report.

     I really liked the idea of making an end to end project that started with lab measurements which were later used to simulate a bigger scenario in [VPItransmissionMaker Optical Systems](http://www.vpiphotonics.com/Tools/OpticalSystems/). <br>Check the presentation we did with our results below:

This is the report we wrote: <center><p><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8qoMCJeZpJAVk56elJEd0lRbk0/preview" width="600" height="400"></iframe></p></center>

  -  The other project I worked in was about making use of [OPNET](www.opnet.com/) to simulate a P2P network under different scenarios. Check the presentation with our results below:

Aalborg University Summer School
--------------------------------

I attended this Summer University during summer of 2012. I had the opportunity to work in a large seven people group (members coming from Denmark, France, Greece and Spain). We were all attending the [Network Coding class](http://kom.aau.dk/~del/SummerSchool2015.html) and we did a practical project trying to asses the advantages of Network Coding in a simple scenario. <br>
Check the slides with our conclusions:

During this Summer School, it was my first contact with [Project Based Learning](http://www.en.aau.dk/about-aau/aalborg-model-problem-based-learning) that I would be working with over the next two years.

Summary
-------

Overall Summer Universities were a really enriching experience. I can therefore not recommend enough to attend at least a Summer University during your studies and maybe later on apply for a summer internship to get relevant industry experience in your field.<br>
At [Skyscanner](www.skyscanner.net) we offer motivated students [summer internships](http://www.skyscanner.net/jobs/graduates/) throughout most of our European offices. Check our [current internships](http://www.skyscanner.net/jobs/graduates/) and do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any doubt!
