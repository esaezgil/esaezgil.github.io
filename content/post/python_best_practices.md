Over the last year I have attended the [Barcelona Python meetup](https://www.meetup.com/python-185/) hosted at [Skyscanner](http://skyscanner.net)'s office. 
The meetups were a really positive experience and being a super welcoming community I decided to deliver a talk. 
<!--more-->

During the talk I covered the most common Python project's structure and the resasoning behind it. I also went over the usual ways for distributing a Python Project and the popular testing tools available. Finally I also mentioned some of the widely regarded best practices for Python like PEP8.
