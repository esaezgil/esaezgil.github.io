I have been enjoying the [Talk Python Podcast](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/all) for a while and at least two episodes revolve around the importance of having a blog as a software developer.

In episode #69 [Write an Excellent Programming Blog](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/69/write-an-excellent-programming-blog) guest [A. Jesse Davis](https://twitter.com/jessejiryudavis) dissects the advice he gives in his own post [Write an Excellent Programming Blog](https://emptysqua.re/blog/write-an-excellent-programming-blog/) with tips for blog content and argues that blogging does not need to be regular but of high quality and lasting value, which I absolutely agree with.

In episode #71 [Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/71/soft-skills-the-software-developer-s-life-manual) guest [John Sonmez](http://twitter.com/jsonmez) emphasizes the importance that the blog had for his own career and encourages others to do so. He also talks about his [book that I read](https://esaezgil.github.io/page/books_finished/) recently.

Both episodes were quite influential on my decision to create my blog.

The main reason that I distilled from both episodes, quoting A. Jesse Davis, is: **'your goal is to attract specialists in your field so you can share ideas with them'**. John Sonmez puts it in another way as finding your niche or specialization and becoming a reference for it.

Furthermore, A. Jesse Davis provides an interesting generic list of topics to write about:

- Story
- Opinion
- How-To
- How Something Works
- Reviews

Reflecting back on my own blog I have covered so far either stories or reviews (Meetups, [Hackathons](https://esaezgil.com/events/), contributing to Open Source, books page). Topics I want to write about in the future are *How-tos* and *How Something Works*. I believe these two last topics are certainly the most valuable for others.

**[Update]** Back in the day I also checked [this post](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-ghost-who-codes-how-anonymity-is/) by [Troy Hunt](https://twitter.com/troyhunt). Although there's some controversy around the topic, I believe that maintaining for a while a technical blog can help me improve my skills. An example for it that I look up to is [Jeff Knupp's blog](https://jeffknupp.com/).

[Scott Hanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman) also refers to the invisible developers as `Dark matter` in his [post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx) and states that there should be a balance between yelling online and getting actual stuff done, which I agree with and personally like to lean towards the actual getting stuff done.

Finally as [Jason Fried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried) suggests in this  [post](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-intimidating-zero-4d90fcdcc3b2), a blog is just about publishing and maybe having someone *magically* find it. It is about fighting the fear of having a zero counter next to the number of visits to your blog for the sake of creation and [giving back to the community](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx).
