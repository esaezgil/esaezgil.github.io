Today I attended [Madrid ProductHunt](https://twitter.com/MadProductHunt) as I was curious about [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com) and about the startup scene in Madrid.
<!--more-->

There were in total 4 presentations about the following projects:

* [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com)
* [Populate](populate.tools)
* [Zensei](https:zenseiapp.com)
* [CityMapper](https://citymapper.com/)

Having spent two years living abroad I had heard about [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com) before and I was very interested in the product and the company itself.

[Nilan](https://twitter.com/nilanp) VP of Growth at Transferwise lead the talk along [Cata](https://twitter.com/cataflu) a software developer in the team. The content itself was very interesting, specially due to the parallelism I could establish between their company and mine, [Skyscanner](https://skyscanner.net):

  - Both companies solve a real issue experienced by millions of people around the world.
  - Both companies focus their growth strategy on making a great product and increasingly building features around it that help spread the word of mouth.
  - Both companies give a great amount of autonomy to their technical teams, including promoting an internal open source policy.
  - Both companies started with a really simple product online, Skyscanner founder put an Excel sheet online and Transferwise founders created a Skype chat and later put a simple form.

[Alvaro Ortiz](https://twitter.com/furilo) introduced [Populate](populate.tools), a company building products to make the public data that governments publish more accessible to citizens through visualizations, normalization and tools that enable to query the data in a single place. He also talked about [Gobierto](http://gobierto.es/) a sort of SaaS for the government to enable effective sharing of the government data. Finally, he shared his personal take on what a startup could be, a lifestyle business and not necessarily an organization focused on achieving a big financial return on a venture capital investment.

The other two talks briefly introduced their companies and some of the problems they faced.
