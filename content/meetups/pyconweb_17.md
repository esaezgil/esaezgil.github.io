The [Pyconweb](https//pyconweb.com) conference took place during the last weekend of May in Munich. The conference aimed to gather people with a common interest for Python-based web development.

The event was held in the premises of the [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://lmu.edu).

The talks I enjoyed most on Saturday were:

- The presentation about [Tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado) from [Jordi Soucheiron](https://twitter.com/jordixou) where he disclosed the importance of async programming for high-performant web servers.

- The presentation about serverless by [Randall Hunt](https://twitter.com/jrhunt). Although the talk felt a bit like an infomercial the demo that he did using Twilio, AWS lambda and API Gateway was really cool.

The talks I enjoyed the most on Sunday were:

- The keynote from [Martijn Faassen](https://twitter.com/faassen), live coding included, about his [Morepath](https://github.com/morepath/morepath) framework and the limitations that frameworks impose on their users.

- How Open Source Changed my Life by [Lasse Schuirmann](https://twitter.com/LSchuirmann) about how a side project of his started getting traction and eventually turned into a businesses.

Having attended the [Barcelona Python meetup](https://www.meetup.com/python-185/) on a regular basis over the last two years, it was a good refresher to get in touch with professionals from all over Europe that rely on Python for their businesses's technological needs.

On the other hand, I expected a higher number of in-depth technical talks that I could apply back to my day-to-day job such as scalability issues, async-programming pitfalls with Pyhigh-availability architectures or management of a large number of microservices.

Finally, the organization was really really good. Lunch was delicious, just like coffee served over the weekend and the social event on Saturday night at [Hofbr√§uhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofbr%C3%A4uhaus_am_Platzl) was spot on.

It was a fun weekend and I look forward to attend other conferences like this one in the future. Maybe Pyconweb 2018? Time will tell.
