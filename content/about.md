Previous experience
--------------------

[Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en), Spain

 * Internship at [Ericsson R&D](https://www.ericsson.com/en) Madrid in the Testing and Continuous Integration team within the [Software Defined Networks](https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/) department.

[MassM2M research group](http://massm2m.es.aau.dk/) at [Aalborg University](http://www.en.aau.dk/), Denmark

* During my [Master studies](http://www.en.aau.dk/education/master/wireless-communication-systems) in Denmark, I had the opportunity to work in the [MassM2M research group](http://massm2m.es.aau.dk/) and participate in the entire product life-cycle, from the initial research up to the development of a prototype for a robust wireless communication system.<br>
Check [this video](https://vimeo.com/66733915) for a demo of the system transmitting audio over WiFi even after a jammer is switched on.

[Reseiwe](http://reseiwe.com/), Denmark

* Also during the Master, I had the chance to work part-time at a startup, [Reseiwe](http://reseiwe.com/), that spin-off from the research group while completing my [Master Thesis](http://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/198541091/main_report_4_june.pdf).
